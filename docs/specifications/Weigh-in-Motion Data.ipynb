    "The Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) Systems can collect data from different kind of devices, like Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR), weigh sensors (piezoelectric quartz, piezoelectric ceramic, piezoelectric polymer, etc), temperature sensors, etc. Additionally, the WIM Systems produce can produce a variety kind of data, like weigh data, classification data, violation information, some analytic reports, etc.\n",

    "Basically, the first main input data is the raw data sensors. These data can be acquired using a device acquisition (DAQ) through analog channels (weigh sensor, temperature sensors, etc) and digital channels (i.e., inductive loops). In COST 323 <a name=\"ref-5\"/>[(Jacob, OBrien and Jehaes, 2002)](#cite-tech:cost-323), was not found any description about the raw data layout. So, this data can be represented by a matrix using a index column with date time instant (or a instant represented by microseconds) and the other columns representing each sensor data.\n",

    "\n",
    "* the time should registered in hh:mm:ss:cc, up to hundreds of second;\n",

    "Recommendations about the file structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* use explicit heading columns;\n",
    "* use units, and, as far as possible, S.I. (System International) must be used;\n",
    "* use a data file in a spreadsheet widly distributed format or a tabulated ASCII format, like CSV;\n",

    "Some information should be present in the output data file to be more completed and offer some detail to future analysis:\n",
